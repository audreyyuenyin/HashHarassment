	<h1> Story Time </h1>
	<p> (Insert Name) is a chrome extension designed by Audrey, coded by Brad and Jason, and pitched by Issac. Special thanks to Arthur, Lukas, Katrina and other mentors at Starterhack, without whom we would not be able to complete this project. The four of us met at this hackathon on March 11, 2017, at University of Waterloo. </p>
	<p>	Incorporating the #HackHarassment topic, and noticing that online harassment is prevalent and noxious, we came up with (Insert Name) in hopes of making the online community better for end users like you and I. Maybe we cannot stop people from posting unfriendly messages, but at least we could stop reading them. Especially for kids, we should protect them from those kind of unnecessary trash. </p>
	<p>	Together, we believe we can all make the web and the world a more peaceful place. Hope you enjoy (Insert Name) and a more positive online community! </p>
